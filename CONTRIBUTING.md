# Contributing to Sorolens
Thank you for your interest. This document covers everything you need to make a contribution: local setup, how to claim an issue, branch naming, commit format, PR requirements, and a full walkthrough of the most common first contribution (adding an XDR type decoder).

## Quickstart: your first PR in 15 minutes

New here? This section gets you from `git clone` to an open pull request in about 15 minutes. Each step links to the detailed section further down if you need more depth.

### 1. Clone and enter the repo (~1 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorolens/sorolens.git
cd sorolens
```

### 2. Install the prerequisites (~5 min)

You need Go 1.23, Node 22, pnpm 9, and a running Docker daemon. Exact versions and install links are in [Prerequisite versions](#prerequisite-versions); the short check:

```bash
go version       # go1.23.x
node --version   # v22.x.x
pnpm --version   # 9.x.x
docker info      # daemon must be running
```

Missing pnpm? `npm install -g pnpm@9`. For Go, Node, or Docker, use the install links in [Prerequisite versions](#prerequisite-versions).

### 3. Start the infrastructure and run the test suite (~4 min)

```bash
docker compose up -d                                # Postgres 16 + Redis on localhost
cd apps/api && go test -race ./...                  # Go API tests
cd ../../services/indexer && go test -race ./...    # indexer tests
cd ../../packages/xdr && pnpm install && pnpm vitest run   # XDR decoder tests
cd ../..
```

Or, after a one-time `pnpm install` at the repo root, run everything at once with `make test`. If all tests pass before you changed anything, your environment is ready.

### 4. Pick an issue and claim it (~2 min)

1. Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/sorolens/sorolens/issues) and filter by `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2. Comment **"I'd like to work on this"** and wait for a maintainer to assign it. Details and etiquette: [How to claim an issue](#how-to-claim-an-issue).

### 5. Branch, code, commit, open the PR (the rest is your change)

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-short-description
# ...make your change and add tests...
git commit -m "feat(scope): short imperative description"
git push origin feat/your-short-description
```

Then open a PR against `main` with `Closes #<issue-number>` in the description. The [Branch naming](#branch-naming), [Commit format](#commit-format), and [PR checklist](#pr-checklist) sections are short and strictly enforced by CI and reviewers — give them a skim before you push.

### Stuck?

Ask in the [Sorolens Discord](https://discord.gg/D9jATUezYX): setup and code questions in `#help`, PRs that need eyes in `#reviews-wanted`. You'll get help there faster than in an issue thread. For deeper setup, see [Local setup per package](#local-setup-per-package).

## How to claim an issue
1. Find an open issue labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or any other label that matches your interest.
2. Leave a comment: "I'd like to work on this." A maintainer will assign it to you within 48 hours.
3. If no response after 48 hours, go ahead and open a PR referencing the issue.
4. Do not open a PR for an issue assigned to someone else without first checking with them.
If you want to work on something not yet tracked as an issue, open an issue first and describe what you plan to do. This avoids duplicate work.

## Running tests
### Go (API, indexer, CLI)
Run from the module root of each package:
```bash
# API
cd apps/api
go test -race ./...
# Indexer
cd services/indexer
go test -race ./...
# CLI
cd cli
go test -race ./...
```
To run the linter:
```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```
Integration tests that require a live database are in files ending `_integration_test.go` and are skipped unless `INTEGRATION=true` is set:
```bash
INTEGRATION=true DATABASE_URL=postgres://... go test -race ./...
```
### TypeScript (XDR package and dashboard)
```bash
# XDR package
cd packages/xdr
pnpm vitest run
# Dashboard
cd apps/web
pnpm vitest run        # unit tests
pnpm build             # verifies the Next.js build succeeds
```
### Rust (fixture contract)
```bash
cd contracts/counter
cargo test
cargo check --target wasm32v1-none
```

## Walkthrough: adding a new XDR type decoder
This is the most common first contribution. The `packages/xdr` package exposes `decodeScVal(base64: string): unknown`, which converts a base64-encoded XDR `ScVal` into a plain JavaScript value. When the decoder encounters an unrecognized `ScVal` type, it returns the raw base64 string unchanged. Adding a new type means handling that case.
### Step 1: understand the ScVal type you are adding
ScVal is defined in [stellar-xdr](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr). Open the XDR source or the `@stellar/stellar-sdk` type definitions and find the `ScVal` union arm you want to handle. For this walkthrough we will add `scvMap` (a key-value map of `ScVal` to `ScVal`).
```typescript
// In @stellar/stellar-sdk, ScVal arms include:
// .switch().name === "scvMap"
// .value() returns xdr.ScMap, which is an array of xdr.ScMapEntry
// each ScMapEntry has .key() and .val(), both of type xdr.ScVal
```
### Step 2: locate the decoder file
```
packages/xdr/
  src/
    decode.ts       <- the main decoder, add your case here
    decode.test.ts  <- tests, add a test here
  index.ts          <- re-exports decodeScVal and decodeTopics
```
Open `src/decode.ts`. You will find a `switch` statement on `scVal.switch().name`:
```typescript
export function decodeScVal(base64: string): unknown {
  const scVal = xdr.ScVal.fromXDR(base64, "base64");
  switch (scVal.switch().name) {
    case "scvBool":
      return scVal.b();
    case "scvU32":
      return scVal.u32();
    case "scvI32":
      return scVal.i32();
    case "scvU64":
      return BigInt(scVal.u64().toString());
    case "scvI64":
      return BigInt(scVal.i64().toString());
    case "scvString":
      return scVal.str().toString("utf8");
    case "scvSymbol":
      return scVal.sym().toString("ascii");
    case "scvBytes":
      return scVal.bytes().toString("hex");
    case "scvAddress":
      return Address.fromScVal(scVal).toString();
    case "scvVec": {
      const vec = scVal.vec();
      return vec ? vec.map((item) => decodeScVal(item.toXDR("base64"))) : [];
    }
    // ... other cases
    default:
      // unrecognized type: return raw base64 so callers can handle it
      return base64;
  }
}
```
### Step 3: add the `scvMap` case
A map should decode to a plain JavaScript object. Keys that decode to a string or symbol become object keys; keys of other types are converted to their string representation.
```typescript
case "scvMap": {
  const entries = scVal.map();
  if (!entries) return {};
  const result: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  for (const entry of entries) {
    const decodedKey = decodeScVal(entry.key().toXDR("base64"));
    const decodedVal = decodeScVal(entry.val().toXDR("base64"));
    // Use the decoded key as a string property name.
    result[String(decodedKey)] = decodedVal;
  }
  return result;
}
```
### Step 4: write a test
Open `src/decode.test.ts` and add a test. The test builds the XDR from scratch using the SDK so it does not depend on a live network.
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { xdr } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { decodeScVal } from "./decode";
describe("decodeScVal", () => {
  // ... existing tests ...
  it("decodes scvMap to a plain object", () => {
    const entry = new xdr.ScMapEntry({
      key: xdr.ScVal.scvSymbol("balance"),
      val: xdr.ScVal.scvU32(42),
    });
    const map = xdr.ScVal.scvMap([entry]);
    const base64 = map.toXDR("base64");
    const result = decodeScVal(base64);
    expect(result).toEqual({ balance: 42 });
  });
  it("returns empty object for an empty scvMap", () => {
    const map = xdr.ScVal.scvMap([]);
    const result = decodeScVal(map.toXDR("base64"));
    expect(result).toEqual({});
  });
});
```
### Step 5: run the tests
```bash
cd packages/xdr
pnpm vitest run
```
All tests should pass. If you see a TypeScript error, check that you imported any SDK types you need at the top of `decode.ts`.
### Step 6: build and verify
```bash
pnpm build
```
This compiles TypeScript to `dist/`. Fix any compilation errors before committing.
### Step 7: commit and open a PR
```bash
git checkout -b feat/xdr-decode-map-type
git add packages/xdr/src/decode.ts packages/xdr/src/decode.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(xdr): add decoder for scvMap type"
git push origin feat/xdr-decode-map-type
```
Open a PR against `main`. Title: `feat(xdr): add decoder for scvMap type`. Body: `Closes #<issue-number>`.
That is the full cycle. Most XDR decoder contributions follow exactly this pattern.

## Troubleshooting
If setup fails, the quickest fixes are usually environment variables or services not running.
### `go: command not found` after installing Go
The Go binary is often installed under `/usr/local/go/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`, which may not be on your `PATH`.
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
# or
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```
Verify the change with:
```bash
go version
```
Windows-specific: add the Go install directory (typically `C:\Program Files\Go\bin`) and your user Go bin directory (for example `C:\Users\<you>\go\bin`) to `PATH`, then restart your terminal.
### Docker daemon is not running
If `docker compose up -d` fails or `docker ps` returns an error, the Docker daemon is usually the issue.
- Start Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows.
- On Linux, start the service and ensure your user can access it:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
```
Then verify the daemon is responsive:
```bash
docker info
```
### `pnpm: command not found`
Node may be installed, but pnpm is not yet available on your `PATH`.
```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9
pnpm --version
```
If `npm` itself is missing, install Node first and then rerun the command above.
### `psql: command not found` (Windows)
The PostgreSQL client tools are not installed or their `bin` directory is not on `PATH`.
Install PostgreSQL or add the PostgreSQL `bin` folder (for example `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin`) to `PATH`, then restart the terminal and verify:
```powershell
psql --version
```
