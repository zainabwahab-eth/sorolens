# Sorolens
Real-time monitoring, alerting, and on-chain health checks for Soroban smart contracts on Stellar. The only observability tool in the Stellar ecosystem with a deployed Soroban **watchdog** contract for proactive contract monitoring.
---
## The problem
Soroban's public RPC retains events for 24 hours and transaction data for up to 7 days. There is no persistent index of what your contract did, what it cost, or which storage entries are close to expiring. The Stellar Lab contract explorer is excellent for point-in-time inspection but has no history, no API, and no way to know when a contract you depend on is unhealthy. Sorolens fills that gap.
---
## What it does
- **Contract event indexing**: every event your contract emits, with decoded topics and values, indexed into Postgres and queryable via REST.
- **Invocation tracing**: per-transaction CPU instructions, memory, ledger I/O bytes, and fees charged.
- **Storage tracking**: snapshot of every temporary, persistent, and instance storage entry, with TTL health.
- **Watchdog monitoring** *(new)*: the on-chain `sorolens-watchdog` Soroban contract lets any contract owner register a contract, push health status, and raise alerts. Sorolens indexes those events and materialises them into a dashboard, giving you the only proactive-monitoring path on Stellar without a centralised heartbeat service.
- **Alerting**: when persistent storage entries are within a configurable number of ledgers of expiry, or when a monitored contract goes `Unresponsive`.
- **Multi-network**: track and query testnet, mainnet, and futurenet contracts side by side, with a network selector in the dashboard header and a `?network=` filter on every list endpoint.
- **Snapshot / replay**: `GET /api/v1/contracts/:id/snapshot?ledger=N` replays a contract's storage state and last known event as of any ledger, with a ledger scrubber on the contract page for time-travel debugging.
- **Scoped API keys**: per-key permissions (`read:contracts`, `write:contracts`, `read:watchdog`, `admin:*`) enforced by route metadata, so a monitoring bot can hold a read-only watchdog key.
- **API playground**: an interactive `/playground` page to explore every endpoint, send requests, and copy them as curl.

## Quickstart
### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.23+
- Node 22+ and pnpm 9+
### 1. Start local dependencies
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This starts Postgres 16 and Redis locally. The `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root maps Postgres to `localhost:5432` and Redis to `localhost:6379`.
### 2. Apply the database schema
```bash
cd services/indexer
go run ./cmd/migrate up
```
### 3. Track a contract and run the indexer
```bash
# Register a contract (uses the local API)
go run ./cmd/sorolens track CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC --network testnet
# Run one indexer cycle manually
go run ./cmd/sorolens index --once
```
The dashboard is at `http://localhost:3000` after `pnpm dev` in `apps/web`.

The **watchdog contract** at `contracts/watchdog/` is the piece that makes Sorolens unique: contracts you operate emit `HealthCheckEvent`, `ContractAlert`, `ContractRegistered`, and `ContractDeregistered` on-chain, the indexer picks them up along with everything else, and the dashboard renders your fleet's live health.

> See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full system diagram, data flows, schema DDL, and REST API reference.

### API reference

The REST API is described by an OpenAPI 3.0 spec at [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml). Load it into Swagger UI, Redoc or Postman, or generate a client from it (the Go client in `packages/go-client` is generated this way). Run `make openapi` after changing a route: it fails if any route is undocumented, lints the spec with Redocly, and regenerates the Go client.
